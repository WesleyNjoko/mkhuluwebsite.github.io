<h4>On this satellite <u>view number 1</u>, if you drive, the pointer is from the direction of the big city of Johannesburg (South Africa) Golden highway, up until the street where the traditional surgey is situated. Pay attention, before the very last corner of your left turn, there is a church (Sancta Maria Catholic Church) and also the double story face break <u>Buyani primary school</u> next to it. <h4>

<h4>On this satellite <u>view number 2</u>, if you use public transport, the pointer is from the direction of the big city of Johannesburg (where you took a taxi from Bree taxi ranks) Golden highway, where the transport will make right turn into the residential area. Pay attention, the public transport will make a left turn around 4th Ave, tell the driver that you are dropping at "KwaMkhulu shops". Once the transport stops, dont even confirm to strangers, just drop and then make double-up to the 5th Ave where the last destination of the pointer is. By the time you are making a double-up, you will pass Buyani primary school on your right! Thokoza<h4>
